This is a draft for new sites with base stuff pre-configured.

The site lives at `dev1.compact` server. It is available at http://d7-starter.io.dev.dev1.compact.amazee.io/

When we create a new project from this draft, we also copy its database, so all modules added to this repository are enabled and preconfigured on the newly created projects. Additional information may be found in [knowledge base](http://confluence.amazeelabs.com/display/KNOWLEDGE/Setup+Drupal).
