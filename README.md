This is a draft for new sites with base stuff pre-configured.

The site lives at `amazeedev1.nine.ch` server in the `~/new-site.com` directory. It is available at http://new-site.com.amazeedev1.nine.ch

Database credentials:
- user: new-site.com
- password: qCZK44pQHJR8pFUz

When we create a new project from this draft, we also copy its database, so all modules added to this repository are enabled and preconfigured on the newly created projects.
